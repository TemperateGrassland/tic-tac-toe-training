TicTacToe Tutorial

### 26/01/25

Add a toggle button that will sort the moves list into ascending or descending order:
- create a new state variable to keep track of the desired ordering
- move the move list into a component
- create a button that when click will flip the value of the state variable and trigger a re-render of the list using the desired outcome.
- default ordering of list is ascending so set var to true
- when clicked, change the var to false and sort the list in descending order and re-render.

Current flow

- user hits a square button
- onclick check for a winner or is square is filled in and then calls handle in play
- handle play creates a new game state and saves it and sets the move - this triggers a re-render of the game components because these two vars belong to the Game component's state.
- moves var is created which consists of a list of <li> with the key $move.
